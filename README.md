# Coding Assignment

## TODO's
- Highlight the selected operator by passing a "selected" prop to Buttons and udpating style
- Chain operations (prevValue to become result, and following operations to take a new currValue
- Format display value in scientific notation after 10 digits
- Add unit testing
- Would've been cool to implement horizontal view


## Bugs
- When you press "=", the display value is 0, and that's confusing
- It looks smaller than expected (should've used full width, and larger numbers)
- AC should become C when currValue is set, and pressing it should remove the value of currValue, but keep prevValue (I think)
